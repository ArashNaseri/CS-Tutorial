# Archiving and Compression
Archiving is the process of combining multiple files and directories (same or different sizes) into one file. On the other hand, compression is the process of reducing the size of a file or directory. Archiving is usually used as part of a system backup or when moving data from one system to another.

Archives are also an essential component of the Linux ecosystem, because all the software you install via your distribution’s package manager will initially be downloaded as a compressed archive from a remote repository. Therefore, working with archives is an important aspect of using a Linux based operating system effectively.

This section will introduce the standard archiving tool used on Linux — which is the `tar` software utility — and demonstrate its usage on the command line to create and work with archives, or tarballs. The `tar` utility is also able to compress an archive via a compression tool. This usage pattern of firstly creating an archive and then compressing it using a compression tool is often adopted for distributing packages remotely.

Compressing an archive can reduce its storage space requirements and is an important step in preparing it for distribution. With these points in mind, this section will also introduce the major compression tools on Linux, and discuss their usage both with tar and individually on the command line. More specifically, we shall take a look at the gzip compression tool.

## Archiving
The most common programs for archiving files and directories are:
1. Tar
2. Zip

### Tar
Tar is a Unix command representative TAPE Archive (tape archive). It is used to combine or store multiple files (same or different sizes) into one file.

When working with tar on the command line, you will often use the same command line options for achieving a specific task — such as creating and extracting archives, as well as listing files within an archive. These frequently used options are detailed here:

- `c` – Create a new archive containing the specified items.
- `f` - An archive file name will be specified.
- `x` – Extract the specified items from the archive to disk.
- `r` – Append file to archive
- `t` - List an archive's content to standard output.
- `v` - Produce verbose output.

The tar utility also provides several options that enable filtering archives through specific compression tools. For example, if you wish to compress an archive with `gzip`, we would pass the `z` option along with the aforementioned cf options. The following table lists the filtering options available to `tar` that we shall use in this tutorial:

#### Examples
##### Create
Create `tar` archive:
```bash
tar c file.txt image.png -f archive.tar
tar cf archive.tar file.txt image.png
tar cfv archive.tar file.txt image.png      # verbose mode
```

##### Extract
Extract `tar` archive:
```bash
tar x -f archive.tar
tar xf archive.tar
tar xfv archive.tar                         # verbose mode
```

We can also use the `-C` or `--one-top-level` option to extract the archive to a different directory.
```bash
tar x -f archive.tar -C output_dir
tar xf archive.tar -C output_dir
tar xfv archive.tar -C output_dir               # verbose mode

tar xfv archive.tar --one-top-level=output_dir  # verbose mode
tar xfv archive.tar --one-top-level  # verbose mode
```
If you don’t assign a directory name to the `--one-top-level` option, files will be extracted into a directory with the same name as the archive:

To extract individual files and directories from the archive, simply append the items you’d like to extract to the end of the command:
```bash
tar xfv archive.tar --one-top-level file.txt image.png
```

##### Append/Delete
It is also possible to list the individual files and directories within an archive:

```bash
tar tfv wallpapers.tar                    # verbose mode
```

If you intend to extract an archive, It is good practice to firstly list the archive’s files before performing the actual extract operation. For example, if you mistakenly downloaded a huge archive and immediately extract all the files before checking it’s content, you could be in some trouble!

Files can also be deleted from an uncompressed.tar archive with the `-delete` option. Therefore, we must firstly decompress an archive before attempting to delete any of its content:

```bash
tar f archive.tar --delete file.txt
```

Conversely, files are appended to an archive via the `-r` option:
```bash
tar f archive.tar -r file.txt
```

## Compression
There are quite a few compression tools available on Linux, with each one implementing a specific compression algorithm.

### `gzip`
Go ahead and install the `gzip` compression tools via your Linux distribution’s package manager:

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S gzip           # Arch
$ sudo apt install gzip         # Debian and Ubuntu
$ sudo dnf install gzip         # Fedora
```

Command line reference:
- `gzip filename` - Compress a file.
- `gzip -d filename.gz` - Decompress a file.
- `-r`, `--recursive` - Travel the directory structure recursively and compress specified file names.
- `-v`, `--verbose` - Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each.

#### Examples
```bash
gzip archive.tar
```
The default behavior of `gzip` is to delete the original file. However, you can force the tool to not do that by using the `-k` command line option.

```bash
gzip -k archive.tar
```

The `tar` utility also provides several options that enable filtering archives through specific compression tools. For example, if you wish to compress an archive with gzip, we would pass the z option along with the aforementioned cf options.

```bash
tar czfv archive.tar.gz file.txt
```

To uncompress a file, use the -d command line option.
```bash
gzip -d archive.tar.gz
```

To recursively compress files, use the `-r` command line option. This option, as the name suggests, will compress files in the main directory as well as all subdirectories.

```bash
gzip -r *
```
All files - whether in main directory or subdirectory - were compressed.

To list details related to compressed file, use `-l` command line option.

```bash
gzip -l archive.tar.gz
```

The `gzip` command also lets you regulate the speed of compression. This you can do by specifying a hyphen `(-)` followed by a number as command line argument to the tool. For example:
```bash
gzip -5 archive.tar
```
Note that you can use any number between 1 and 9, where `-1` (or `--fast`) indicates fastest compression while `-9` (or `--best`) indicates slowest (but best).

### `zip`


## Summary
- Tarballs are containers to store files in for compression.
- Tarballs can be compressed using various compression algorithms.
- `gzip` and `bzip2` (not convered here) are common options on linux. `xz` is another option.
- You can also use the `zip` and `unzip` commands to create/extract `.zip` files.
