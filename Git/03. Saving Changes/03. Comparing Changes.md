# Comparing Changes

Diffing is a function that takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them. `git diff` is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a `diff` function on Git data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more.

This section will discuss common invocations of `git diff` and diffing work flow patterns. The `git diff` command is often used along with git status and git log to analyze the current state of a Git repo.

## Reading `diff` Output

### Raw output format
If we execute `git diff` when there are no changes, there will be no output. This is expected behavior as there are no changes in the repo to `diff`.

Once the repo is created and we've added some changes, such as adding `diff_test.txt` file, we can change the contents of the file to start experimenting with diff output.

Let us now examine a more detailed breakdown of the diff output.

1. Comparison Input
```
diff --git a/diff_test.txt b/diff_test.txt
```

This line displays the input sources of the diff. We can see that `a/diff_test.txt` and `b/diff_test.txt` have been passed to the diff.

2. Meta Data
```
index 3b18e51..1ca31a6 100644
```
This line displays some internal Git metadata. You will most likely not need this information. The numbers in this output correspond to Git object version hash identifiers.

3. Markers for Changes
```
--- a/diff_test.txt
+++ b/diff_test.txt
```
These lines are a legend that assigns symbols to each diff input source. In this case, changes from `a/diff_test.txt` are marked with a `---` and the changes from `b/diff_test.txt` are marked with the `+++` symbol.

4. Diff Chunks
The remaining `diff` output is a list of `diff` 'chunks'. A `diff` only displays the sections of the file that have changes. In our current example, we only have one chunk as we are working with a simple scenario. Chunks have their own granular output semantics.

```
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello world
+this line is NEW
```
The first line is the chunk header. Each chunk is prepended by a header inclosed within `@@` symbols. The content of the header is a summary of changes made to the file. In our simplified example, we have -1 +1 meaning line one had changes. In a more realistic `diff`, you would see a header like:

```
@@ -34,6 +34,8 @@
```
In this header example, 6 lines have been extracted starting from line number 34. Additionally, 8 lines have been added starting at line number 34.

The remaining content of the diff chunk displays the recent changes. Each changed line is prepended with a `+` or `-` symbol indicating which version of the diff input the changes come from. As we previously discussed, `-` indicates changes from the `a/diff_test.txt` and `+` indicates changes from `b/diff_test.txt`.

## Comparing files: `git diff file`

By default `git diff` will show you any uncommitted changes since the last commit.

### Comparing files between two different commits

git diff can be passed Git refs to commits to diff. Some example refs are, **HEAD**, **tags**, and **branch names**. Every commit in Git has a commit `ID` which you can get when you execute `GIT LOG`. You can also pass this commit ID to `git diff`.
