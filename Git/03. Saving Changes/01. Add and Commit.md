# Add and Commit
Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern. First, you edit your files in the working directory. When you’re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with git add. After you’re happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with git commit.

## `git add`
When working in Git, or other version control systems, the concept of "saving" is a more nuanced process than saving in a word processor or other traditional file editing applications. The traditional software expression of "saving" is synonymous with the Git term "committing" and Git committing is an operation that acts upon a collection of files and directories.

The `git add` command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, `git add` doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.

The primary function of the git add command, is to promote pending changes in the working directory, to the git staging area. The staging area is one of Git's more unique features, and it can take some time to wrap your head around it. The staging area is considered one of the "three trees" of Git, along with, the working directory, and the commit history.

Instead of committing all of the changes you've made since the last commit, the stage lets you group related changes into highly focused snapshots before actually committing it to the project history. This means you can make all sorts of edits to unrelated files, then go back and split them up into logical commits by adding related changes to the stage and commit them piece-by-piece. As in any revision control system, it’s important to create atomic commits so that it’s easy to track down bugs and revert changes with minimal impact on the rest of the project.
