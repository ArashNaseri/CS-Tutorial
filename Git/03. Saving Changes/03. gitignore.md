# gitignore

Git sees every file in your working copy as one of three things:

1. Tracked - a file which has been previously staged or committed.
2. Untracked - a file which has not been staged or committed.
3. Ignored - a file which Git has been explicitly told to ignore.

Ignored files are usually build artifacts and machine generated files that can be derived from your repository source or should otherwise not be committed. Some common examples are:

- Dependency caches, such as the contents of `/node_modules` or `/packages`
- Compiled code, such as `.o`, `.pyc`, and `.class` files
- Build output directories, such as `/bin`, `/out`, or `/target`
- Files generated at runtime, such as `.log`, `.lock`, or `.tmp`
- Hidden system files, such as `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db`
- Personal IDE config files, such as `.idea/workspace.xml`

Ignored files are tracked in a special file named `.gitignore` that is checked in at the root of your repository. There is no explicit git ignore command: instead the `.gitignore` file must be edited and committed by hand when you have new files that you wish to ignore. `.gitignore` files contain patterns that are matched against file names in your repository to determine whether or not they should be ignored.

## Git Ignore Patterns
`.gitignore` uses [globbing patterns](http://linux.die.net/man/7/glob) to match against file names. You can construct your patterns using various symbols:

|Pattern|Example Matches|Explanation*|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`**/logs`|`logs/debug.log`<br>`logs/monday/foo.bar`<br>`build/logs/debug.log`|You can prepend a pattern with a double asterisk to match directories anywhere in the repository.|
|`**/logs/debug.log`|`logs/debug.log` <br> `build/logs/debug.log` <br> but NOT `logs/build/debug.log`|You can also use a double asterisk to match files based on their name and the name of their parent directory.|
|`*.log`|`debug.log` <br> `foo.log` <br>`.log` <br> `logs/debug.log`|An asterisk is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters.|
|`*.log` <br> `!important.log`|`debug.log` <br> `trace.log` <br> but NOT <br> `important.log` <br> `logs/important.log`|Prepending an exclamation mark to a pattern negates it. If a file matches a pattern, but also matches a negating pattern defined later in the file, it will not be ignored.|
|`*.log` <br> `!important/*.log` <br> `trace.*`|`debug.log` <br> `important/trace.log` <br> but NOT `important/debug.log`|Patterns defined after a negating pattern will re-ignore any previously negated files.|
|`/debug.log`|`debug.log` <br> but NOT `logs/debug.log`|Prepending a slash matches files only in the repository root.|
|`debug.log`|`debug.log` <br> `logs/debug.log`|By default, patterns match files in any directory|
|`debug?.log`|`debug0.log` <br> `debugg.log` <br> but NOT `debug10.log`|A question mark matches exactly one character.|
|`debug[0-9].log`|`debug0.log` <br> `debug1.log` <br> but NOT `debug10.log`|Square brackets can also be used to match a single character from a specified range.|
|`debug[01].log`|`debug0.log` <br> `debug1.log` <br> but NOT <br> `debug2.log` <br> `debug01.log`|Square brackets match a single character form the specified set.|
|`debug[!01].log`|`debug2.log` <br> but NOT <br> `debug0.log` <br> `debug1.log` <br> `debug01.log`|An exclamation mark can be used to match any character except one from the specified set.|
|`debug[a-z].log`|`debuga.log` <br> `debugb.log` <br> but NOT `debug1.log`|Ranges can be numeric or alphabetic.|
|`logs`|`logs` <br> `logs/debug.log` <br> `logs/latest/foo.bar` <br> `build/logs` <br> `build/logs/debug.log`|If you don't append a slash, the pattern will match both files and the contents of directories with that name. In the example matches on the left, both directories and files named logs are ignored|
|`logs/`|`logs/debug.log` <br> `logs/latest/foo.bar` <br> `build/logs/foo.bar` <br> `build/logs/latest/debug.log`|Appending a slash indicates the pattern is a directory. The entire contents of any directory in the repository matching that name – including all of its files and subdirectories – will be ignored|
|`logs/` <br> `!logs/important.log`|`logs/debug.log` <br> `logs/important.log`|Wait a minute! Shouldn't logs/important.log be negated in the example on the left <br> <br> Nope! Due to a performance-related quirk in Git, you can not negate a file that is ignored due to a pattern matching a directory|
|`logs/**/debug.log`|`logs/debug.log` <br> `logs/monday/debug.log` <br> `logs/monday/pm/debug.log`|A double asterisk matches zero or more directories.|
|`logs/*day/debug.log`|`logs/monday/debug.log` <br> `logs/tuesday/debug.log` <br> but NOT <br> `logs/latest/debug.log`|Wildcards can be used in directory names as well.|
|`logs/debug.log`|`logs/debug.log` <br> but NOT <br> `debug.log` <br> `build/logs/debug.log`|Patterns specifying a file in a particular directory are relative to the repository root. (You can prepend a slash if you like, but it doesn't do anything special.)|
