# Configuration

Once you have a remote repo setup, you will need to add a remote repo url to your local git config, and set an upstream branch for your local branches. The git remote command offers such utility:
- `git remote add <remote_name> <remote_repo_url>`

This command will map remote repository at  to a ref in your local repo under. Once you have mapped the remote repo you can push local branches to it:
- `git push -u <remote_name> <local_branch_name>`

This command will push the local repo branch under `<local_branch_name>` to the remote repo at `<remote_name>`.

**Note:** If you clone a repo, your remote is already set up. You can see the list of remotes by running `git remote -v`.
