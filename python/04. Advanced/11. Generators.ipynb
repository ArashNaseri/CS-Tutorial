    "Have you ever had to work with a dataset so large that it overwhelmed your machine’s memory? Or maybe you have a complex function that needs to maintain an internal state every time it’s called, but the function is too small to justify creating its own class. In these cases and more, generators and the Python yield statement are here to help."

    "## Using Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduced with [PEP 255](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255), generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory. For an overview of iterators in Python, take a look at Python “for” Loops (Definite Iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a rough idea of what a generator does, you might wonder what they look like in action. Let’s take a look at two examples. In the first, you’ll see how generators work from a bird’s eye view. Then, you’ll zoom in and examine each example more thoroughly."
